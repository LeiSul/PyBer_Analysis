# PyBer_Analysis

## Pyber Analysis Overview

The report reflects specific city type data to show ride share differences based on location. Ranging from 
total rides, total drivers, total fares paid, average fare per ride or driver, and the total fare based on 
city type. This break down allows us to view the differences within the data, and use the information to 
address the disparities.

After review of the data in the image shown above we noticed the following for each city type: 

#### Rural
In the Rural locations we see very little activity, as well as far fewer drivers, however, the fare
cost is substantially higher compared to Urban and Suburban averages.

#### Urban
In the Urban areas we see that more drivers exist than rides, compared to Rural and Suburban numbers. It 
also reflects the highest number of rides.

#### Suburban
